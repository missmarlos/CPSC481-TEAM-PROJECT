Project Description
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A succinct description of your project idea, how you expect your system to be used, by whom, and the context under which
you expect it to be used

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The idea that our group has decided on is an informational app for dog enthusiasts which we have called 'Barkipedia'. With
our app, we expect it to be used as way to find vital information about dog care, discover dog-friendly events around Calgary,
find dog services around them, and interact with other users through forum posts and reviews.


Stakeholders
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Provide a list of stakeholders, and describe them as they relate to the design of the system

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Barkipedia's target audience will encompass people who are curious about dogs but have a limited knowledge on them,
long-time dog owners who would consider themselves experts, and everyone else in between. These are the expected
stakeholders we have identified.

List of Stakeholders:
- Experienced Dog-Owners
- Inexperienced Dog-Owners
- Future Dog-Owners
- Calgary Community
- Influencers / Dog Enthusiasts

Barkipedia's target audience will encompass people who are long time / short time dog-owners, future dog-owners, dog
enthusiasts, and the Calgary community overall.

Experienced and inexperienced dog-owners are the expected central stakeholders for Barkipedia. The way they will use the
app will be through asking and answering questions on Barkipedia's forum - Bark Overflow, set up online profiles for
themselves and their dogs, browse through services and events around Calgary, and leave reviews for other users who are
interested in getting feedback from the community.

Future dog-owners are another stakeholder we believe will be part of Barkipedia's user base. We expect that these users
will use the app in exactly like the experience and inexperienced users, but with more of a focus on searching for more
basic information that is typical of those that are looking into getting a dog. This information include searches about
tips and tricks, finances, home environment, energy levels, and amount of time required to care for that certain dog.
These users and the inexperienced dog-owners are what we expect to be the main bulk of contributors of the Bark-Overflow
forum in form of asking questions.

The community at large entails individuals and groups who would not normally be using our app directly but would still be
benefiting from the app’s features as a stakeholder. For example, dog service business would certainly have the potential
to benefit from our ‘reviews’ feature as their business would be listed and rated by our users. Event coordinators may
benefit as well from the features such as the review functionality, and the events and Bark-Overflow features. Being able
to get any sort of attention on platforms where users are looking for events are huge for coordinators, along with being
able to communicate to potential and current attendees via the forum can benefit event popularity greatly.

Furthermore, ‘influencers’ should also be considered as stakeholders for our project. These are the people with a large
following and are trusted by many to provide reliable, accurate information. They can include businesses that provide dog
services, community centers, cafes and restaurants, organizations, etc. The way they relate to the design of our system
is through reviews and Bark-Overflow. Due to their popularity they would be able to give advice through reviews and
through forum responses. Dog enthusiasts can fall into this category as well as stakeholders, as dog enthusiasts can be
either a current dog owner or prospective dog owner.

User Research Section

Discuss the user research methods you used, provide justification for them, and provide a summary of your findings from each of these methods

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Matt - Extreme User Interview

The research method that our group conducted was the Extreme User Interview. Matt interviewed 2 long time dog owners and
one person who wholly intends to get a dog in the future. This research method was chosen because it gives an in depth
insight on how effective the methods of research they used were, as well as information about how much value they give
to advice given to them from other dog owners about behavioral/medicinal/equipment, etc., and the  likelihood that of them
interacting with other dog owners in the community through a forum. This was important because our app is centered around
interaction between members of online communities related to the aforementioned points.

Marela - Secondary Research
The second research method that was selected was Secondary Research. Regarding our project's context, it is a fitting method
to aid in our investigation phase because our project idea combines functionalities present in well-known applications into
one. Throughout our secondary research, we continuously reminded ourselves that our users include people looking for a very
convenient way to finding infromation that will help maximize their current or future dog's well-being. With that in mind we
investigated systems that were directly related to Barkipedia's main features : Reviews, Forums, Event information, and basic
information.

Summary of research Findings

Matt - Extreme User Interview Summary
In summary, the types of research done by both extremes were very similar. Most topics searched were behavioural, where
breed specific searches was the most common. The importance of user reviews throughout all interviewees were evident
and advice from other dog-owners with the same breed was held in high regard. The importance of peer reviews with relevant
experience was very important

Reflect on your use of the methods -- what went well, what went poorly, and what would you do differently

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What went good:
•	I got some in depth answers about what pieces of advice the interviewees would take more seriously over other advice given to them by other dog owners.
•	Good insight as to what questions people would be asking online communities, and which they could just generally research.
•	Information about how ratings influenced decisions for services.
What went bad:
•	Some questions didn’t take into account some people who would have done both methods of    research discussed.
•	Our evaluation of past experiences was hard to define as most of the “pre existing solutions”  are just google searches.
What would I do differently?
•	Try and define more specific pre-existing solutions to evaluate
•	Target users who have actually used dog related apps as opposed to people who have just done research via google.










Provide 6-8 task descriptions of how you expect the system to be used.
You should also provide links to any materials used in your user research to serve as proof that you conducted the research methods.
Examples could include (but are not limited to): photos of you and your interviewee, interview questions, raw notes from observations,
photos from ethnography, survey questions, etc. If appropriate, using images of these in your write-up would likely be a good idea.
